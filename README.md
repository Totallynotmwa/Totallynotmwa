== Im rarely GitHub Under Protest since every dev relies on this site ==

Am using github.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  Am are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to to do issues and stuff. I need it for some pull requests,issues,etc.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Good news i dont use this site anymore its rarely as mentioned above.
